## URLtoRepeater
A burp Jython plugin to add a URL quickly to Repeater.

This plugin simply adds a `URL to Repeater` tab in Burpsuite. Simply paste a full URL in the box and hit the button and a new Repeater tab will be created with a basic request for your URL. Dunno, I just wanted to make importing a URL faster than having to launch a browser, visit it, find it in the HTTP History and from there send it to Repeater with ctrl+R. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
